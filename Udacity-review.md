## Meets Specifications
Dear Soni Pandey,
You did an awesome job
It looks like you have given the project respect and time. Kudos to you for that!! :sparkles:
You deserve much appreciation for this!! :gift:
For any queries, you can ask on Knowledge Portal as well [https://knowledge.udacity.com/]
All the best for the Nanodegree!
Stay Safe

## Code Functionality and Readability
All the project code is contained in a Jupyter notebook, which demonstrates successful execution and output of the code.

Code has an easy-to-follow logical structure. Jupyter notebooks are great for this.

Code has easy-to-follow logical structure. The code uses comments effectively and/or Notebook Markdown cells correctly. The steps of the data science process (gather, assess, clean, analyze, model, visualize) are clearly identified with comments or Markdown cells, as well. The naming for variables and functions should be according to PEP8 style guide.

Great job on making the work very clear and easy to follow. Markdown cells are used to clearly indicate different sections of the notebook. Apart from markdown cells, the project also makes use of inline python comments.

How to use shortcuts with Jupyter Notebook

Code is well documented and uses functions and classes as necessary. All functions include document strings. DRY principles are implemented.

Data
Project follows the CRISP-DM process outlined for questions through communication. This can be done in the README or the notebook. If a question does not require machine learning, descriptive or inferential statistics should be used to create a compelling answer to a particular question.

Good job adopting the CRISP-DM!

## Resources
This link explains why CRISP-DM is useful and what the sections should contain.
This slides contains highlighted points for each step for CRISP-DM for more details.
Categorical variables are handled appropriately for machine learning models (if models are created). Missing values are also handled appropriately for both descriptive and ML techniques. Document why a particular approach was used, and why it was appropriate for a particular situation.

Good job mentioning some data wrangling/preparation steps for the target variable especially. Please note that it is important to mention data preparation steps as well in order to prove the reproducibility and authenticity of your model's result. For instance, my first questions for the linear regression model will be to know whether you scaled your data, and by what means.

## Analysis, Modeling, Visualization
There are between 3-5 questions asked, related to the business or real-world context of the data. Each question is answered with an appropriate visualization, table, or statistic.

Good job highlighting the business questions!

## Github Repository
Student must have a Github repository of their project. The repository must have a README.md file that communicates the libraries used, the motivation for the project, the files in the repository with a small description of each, a summary of the results of the analysis, and necessary acknowledgements. Students should not use another student's code to complete the project, but they may use other references on the web including StackOverflow and Kaggle to complete the project.

Great work already with the Github repository, the README file looks good!

## Blog Post
### Student must have a blog post on a platform of their own choice (can be on their website, a Medium post or Github blog post). Student must communicate their results clearly. The post should not dive into technical details or difficulties of the analysis - this should be saved for Github. The post should be understandable for non-technical people from many fields.

Good job providing a link to the blog post!:thumbsup: The results are clearly communicated with less technical details.

### Student must have a title and image to draw readers to their post.

The title alongside the image is very engaging and interesting as well.

### There are no long, ongoing blocks of text without line breaks or images for separation anywhere in the post.

Nicely done! No long, ongoing blocks of text without line breaks or images for separation anywhere in the post.

### Each question is answered with a clear visual, table, or statistic that provides how the data supports or disagrees with some hypothesis that could be formed by each question of interest.
