# Stack Overflow 2020 Survey

## Motivation -
This is regarding Udacity Nanodegree Program and for this I have picked up Stack Overflow 2020 Developer Survey. I found this survey data useful and able to analyze dataset from beginner perspective.

## CRISP-DM Steps
This is important steps to involve in our data analysis process, which is CRISP-DM. CRISP-DM stands for Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining. CRISP-DM has 6 stages - 

### 1. Business Understanding - 
Looking at the stackoverflow survey data, these are the questions came in my mind - 

* What most Languages has been worked all over the world?
* What are the top 10 countries who took this survey?
* What are the most Languages worked in India?

There can be many other questions which can come to our mind and everyone has diffrent set of mind. This process is known as Business Understanding.


### 2. Data Understanding -
There's many columns in survey dataset. But for giving answers of our question what data will be used. This part understand as Data understanding.

### 3. Prepare Data - 
For doing analysis of above 3 questions, we need to handle missing data and mold the data according to our requirement. This steps is known as Data Munching also.

### 4. Data Modeling -
In this step we try diffrent algorithm with training dataset and see which model best fit in our situation.

### 5. Evaluate - 
The analysis of the choosen model, we need to check the Accuracy, Precision Matrix, Confusion Matrix or Mean Square Root Error based on the choosen algorithm. There might be the scenerio where we need to rework on our models if the accuracy score is low.

### 6. Deploy -
Once we're ready with our model, the final stage is deployment. Like, we can use AWS or any other platform to deploy our model and our customer can also access this.

## Prerequiste
1. Python
2. Important Libraries which needs to be installed (Numpy, Pandas & Matplotlib)

## Project Overview -
I have used Stack Overflow 2020 Survey data and these are the business question -

* What most Languages has been worked all over the world?
* What are the top 10 countries who took this survey?
* What are the most Languages worked in India?

## Notebook File

You can find the source code in root directory by this filename **StackOverflowSurvey.ipynb**.
In this file, you'll see how we have reached to our analysis part and what steps we have followed to reach our goal.
